#Stock Picking App


Using the database app
=====================

First, log into `db` with your William and Mary account. By default the app is configured to run on the 'caweins sp3' database.If you cannot access this database, please see Appendix D of the Stage-4 paper. Otherwise:

```
git clone https://github.com/caweinshenker/Stock-Picker.git
cd Stock-Picker
python app.py
```

Then, finally navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to see the app!
